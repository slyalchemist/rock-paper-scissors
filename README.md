Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors project! 

This project is the first one where I will be independantly creating a code in which I will use JavaScript to present a game of rock, paper, scissors to the user. 

The first iterations of this project will be very bare bones as I attempt to get the game up and running! It will possibly see some aesthetic updates in the future!
